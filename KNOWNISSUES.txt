- "modalSession has been exited prematurely - check for a re-entrant call to endModalSession" is a Mac specific bug
  when closing modal dialogs and the only fix is updating the Qt library.

- Analyzer crashes on exit if the Capture tool GUI is executed before (Windows only). The capture window is being
 deleted twice, in the exec_ loop (because the deleteLater call) and when the QApplication leaves the scope (because
  the deleterLater call inside the makeApplication). Workaround was to insert an argument to disable this last call.
